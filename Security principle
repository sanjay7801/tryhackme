CIA:

     Confidentiality ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
     Integrity aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
      Availability aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.


Beyond CIA

Parkerian Hexad
      In 1998, Donn Parker proposed the Parkerian Hexad, a set of six security elements. They are:

          Availability
          Utility
          Integrity
          Authenticity
          Confidentiality
          Possession


Utility: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information.
Possession: This security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling.


DAD

  The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

              Disclosure is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
              Alteration is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
              Destruction/Denial is the opposite of Availability.
