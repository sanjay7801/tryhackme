Penetration Testing 
    A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information.
    A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

Penetration Testing Ethics 
    a penetration test is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems


Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into. Let's cover these three in the table below:

    Hat Category	                                                        Description                                                                                                      	Example

     White Hat	            These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.	                      For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.
     Grey Hat	       These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.	               For example, someone taking down a scamming site.
      Black Hat	            These people  are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.         	For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.
